# Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains an implementation of wine quality prediction using Linear Regression. The goal is to build a basic linear regression model to predict wine quality based on various attributes.

## Requirements

- Python 
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the `data` directory. It includes wine attributes and the quality rating (target variable).

## Model Training

The linear regression model is trained using the training data and saved for later use.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset, using R-squared (R2) metrics.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
